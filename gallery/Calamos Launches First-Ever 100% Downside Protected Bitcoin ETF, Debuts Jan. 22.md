# Calamos Launches First-Ever 100% Downside Protected Bitcoin ETF, Debuts Jan. 22

Calamos Investments has unveiled a groundbreaking financial instrument: the first Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) offering complete downside protection. This innovative product, scheduled to debut on January 22, 2025, under the ticker **CBOJ** on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), represents a paradigm shift in cryptocurrency investment strategies.

## How the CBOJ ETF Works  

The CBOJ ETF combines U.S. Treasury bonds with options linked to the CBOE Bitcoin US ETF Index. This hybrid structure enables investors to participate in Bitcoin's upside potential while eliminating exposure to downside risks. Unlike conventional ETFs, CBOJ resets its downside protection annually, guaranteeing investors a new upside cap each year while maintaining full principal safeguards.

> "Many investors have been hesitant to invest in Bitcoin due to its epic volatility," explains Matt Kaufman, Head of ETFs at Calamos. "Our solution addresses this concern directly by capturing Bitcoin's growth potential while mitigating historically high volatility."

## CBOJ: A New Era in Crypto Investment  

CBOJ enters the market as part of a broader trend where traditional finance bridges gaps with cryptocurrency. Defined outcome products, particularly buffer funds, gained traction following the 2022 market downturn. By integrating strategies similar to equity ETFs, this product sets a precedent for risk-managed crypto exposure.

Structured Bitcoin ETFs have gained momentum since spot Bitcoin funds launched in January 2024 attracted billions in inflows. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), the most prominent among them, now holds over $50 billion in assets. However, financial advisors have remained cautious due to Bitcoin's historical price swings.

### Why Advisors Are Paying Attention  

Kaufman emphasizes that professionals seeking crypto exposure increasingly demand risk-managed frameworks. "For folks looking to access that space, they want to do so in a structure that makes sense for their portfolio," he explains. CBOJ's annual reset feature ensures sustained protection, allowing investors to ride crypto market cycles without exposure to catastrophic losses.

## Key Features Setting CBOJ Apart  

1. **Annual Reset Mechanism**: Each year's upside cap is determined by options pricing, with the initial cap finalized on January 22, 2025.  
2. **Dual Asset Strategy**: Combines Bitcoin options with U.S. Treasury holdings for balanced risk-reward dynamics.  
3. **Structured Protection**: Guarantees principal preservation while participating in Bitcoin's growth up to annual caps.
