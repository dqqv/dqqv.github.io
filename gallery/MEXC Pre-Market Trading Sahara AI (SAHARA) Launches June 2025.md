## Understanding MEXC Pre-Market Trading

MEXC's Pre-Market Trading system offers qualified participants early access to emerging tokens through an over-the-counter (OTC) marketplace. This mechanism provides several advantages:
- Price discovery before public listing
- Opportunity to secure positions at potentially favorable rates
- Risk mitigation through collateral-backed settlements

### Strategic Trading Window

The SAHARA token will follow this structured timeline:
| Event | Date (UTC) |
|-------|------------|
| Pre-Market Trading Begins | Jun 21, 2025, 05:00 |
| Pre-Market Trading Ends | Jun 26, 2025, 11:00 |
| Spot Market Launch | Jun 26, 2025, 12:00 |
| Settlement Process Begins | Jun 26, 2025, 13:30 |

This carefully designed schedule allows participants sufficient time to assess market dynamics while ensuring smooth transition to public trading.

## Pre-Market Trading Mechanics

### Participant Roles

Traders can engage as either:
- **Makers**: Setting price parameters and waiting for matches
- **Takers**: Accepting existing orders at specified prices

Both roles require collateralization of assets to ensure settlement integrity. This mechanism protects all parties while maintaining market stability.

### Collateral Requirements

The collateral rate determines the percentage of order value that must be secured. Current MEXC policy maintains:
- **Zero trading fees** for Pre-Market participants
- **100% collateral requirement** for sellers
- **Variable buyer collateral rates** based on market conditions

## Risk Management Framework

MEXC has implemented robust safeguards:
- Automated settlement processes
- Time-bound execution windows
- Penalty mechanisms for non-performance
- Transparent collateral handling

The system ensures that:
1. Buyers receive guaranteed token delivery upon successful settlement
2. Sellers maintain adequate liquidity positions
3. Market integrity remains preserved through enforced collateral requirements

## Participant Guidelines

### For Buyers:
1. Funds are frozen upon order placement
2. Fees deducted immediately upon settlement
3. Compensation available if seller defaults

### For Sellers:
1. Must maintain sufficient token balances
2. Collateral forfeited for failed settlements
3. Receives payment upon successful delivery

This balanced framework protects both parties while encouraging responsible trading behavior.

## Fee Structure and Penalties

| Component | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Trading Fees | 0% (Currently) |
| Late Settlement | 100% collateral compensation to buyer |
| Failed Orders | No fees charged |
| Liquidity Provision | Rewards through successful matches |

MEXC's commitment to zero fees during this phase demonstrates confidence in the platform's risk management capabilities.
