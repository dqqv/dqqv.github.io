# Telegram Wallet: Comprehensive Guide on How to Use It

## Understanding Telegram Wallet

Telegram Wallet is a blockchain-powered tool integrated into the Telegram messaging platform, enabling users to manage cryptocurrencies seamlessly. Built on the **TON (The Open Network) blockchain**, this wallet allows users to send, receive, and store cryptocurrencies directly within Telegram chats. Unlike non-custodial wallets like MetaMask, Telegram Wallet operates as a **custodial wallet**, meaning a third party manages the private keys. While this raises potential security concerns, it simplifies recovery processes through customer support. For advanced users, Telegram introduced **TON Space**, a self-custodial option offering full control over private keys and assets.

Key features include:
- Fee-free cryptocurrency transactions (TON, Bitcoin, Tether).
- Support for "multi cheques" to distribute crypto to multiple users.
- P2P Market for trading at preferred rates.
- Integration with decentralized exchanges (DEXs) via TON Space.

### Security and Historical Context

Telegramâ€™s cryptocurrency journey began in 2019 with plans for a TON-based wallet. However, a 2020 U.S. SEC lawsuit over its $1.7 billion ICO halted initial efforts. After settling with an $18.5 million fine, Telegram relaunched its crypto initiatives, leading to the 2023 beta launch of **TON Space**. This update boosted Toncoinâ€™s value by 14%, highlighting market confidence in Telegramâ€™s ecosystem.
