# Pi Cryptocurrency: Price Recovery Gains Momentum as Banxa Secures KYB Approval for Global Transactions

## Banxa's KYB Approval: A Game Changer for Pi Network

In a landmark development for the Pi Network ecosystem, Banxa has secured Know Your Business (KYB) regulatory approval, revolutionizing how users worldwide can access Pi Coin (PI). This strategic milestone, announced on May 6, 2025, enables direct fiat-to-Pi transactions across 100+ countries, marking a significant leap toward mainstream adoption. The payment gateway's compliance certification addresses critical regulatory requirements while expanding transactional capabilities for the blockchain project born from mobile mining.

**Key Implications of Banxa's KYB Approval:**
- **Global Accessibility**: Users in 130+ jurisdictions can now purchase Pi Coin using local currencies
- **Institutional Validation**: Regulatory compliance strengthens Pi's legitimacy in traditional finance circles
- **Liquidity Boost**: Direct fiat pathways are expected to enhance market depth and trading volume

> "This approval demonstrates the maturing crypto regulatory landscape," notes blockchain analyst Maria Chen. "Platforms that prioritize compliance are positioning themselves for long-term viability in institutional markets."

The KYB certification follows a temporary transaction pause on Banxa's platform, during which industry speculation suggested the company might have accumulated Pi reserves at favorable rates. However, insiders confirm the suspension was a strategic move to complete regulatory upgrades, with trading resuming at a 34% premium to pre-suspension levels.

### Regulatory Framework and User Requirements

Banxa's updated policies emphasize strict compliance measures:
- **Business Transactions**: Limited to KYB-approved entities only
- **Individual Users**: Must complete KYC verification and utilize non-custodial wallets for P2P transfers
- **Exchange Partnerships**: Platforms like BitMart and HTX are currently undergoing KYB certification, with approvals expected within the next two weeks

## Price Dynamics and Market Outlook

Despite recent positive developments, Pi Coin's price trajectory continues to face headwinds. Current trading at $0.50 reflects an 82% decline from its all-time high of $3 set in early 2024. However, market indicators suggest potential stabilization as the ecosystem matures:

| Price Metric          | Current Value | 24H Change | Key Resistance |
|-----------------------|---------------|----------|----------------|
| Pi Coin (PI)          | $0.50         | +2.5%    | $0.60          |
| Market Cap            | $23.5B        | +3.1%    | $28B           |
| Trading Volume (24H)  | $1.2B         | +18%     | $1.5B          |

**Market Analyst Takeaways:**
- Token unlocks will gradually decrease post-May 15, 2025, reducing selling pressure
- $0.60 psychological barrier represents next key resistance level
- Breakthrough above $0.75 could trigger institutional buying spree

### Technical Analysis and Trading Psychology

The recent 2.5% surge aligns with seasonal crypto market trends observed in Q2 2025. On-chain analytics reveal:
- 63% of holders are now in profit territory
- Average holding period increased to 89 days (up from 62 in Q4 2024)
- Whale transactions (>1M PI) decreased by 41% month-over-month
