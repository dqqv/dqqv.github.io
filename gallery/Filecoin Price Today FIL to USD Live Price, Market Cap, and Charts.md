# Filecoin Price Today: FIL to USD Live Price, Market Cap, and Charts  

Filecoin is a decentralized file storage system built on its own blockchain, utilizing the FIL token as its native cryptocurrency. Designed to revolutionize cloud storage, Filecoin leverages the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to create an open market for data storage, where clients and providers interact through incentivized agreements. This article explores how Filecoin works, its price dynamics, and its role in the decentralized web ecosystem.  

## How Does Filecoin Work?  

Filecoin operates as a decentralized storage marketplace where users (clients) pay FIL tokens to store data securely. Providersâ€”individuals or organizations with excess storage capacityâ€”earn FIL by offering their resources. This system ensures data integrity through two consensus mechanisms: **proof-of-replication (PoRep)** and **proof-of-spacetime (PoSt)**.  

### Key Components of the Filecoin Network  
1. **Clients**: Users who pay FIL to store files.  
2. **Providers**: Storage miners who earn FIL by hosting client data.  
3. **Blockchain**: Records transactions, proofs, and storage agreements.  
4. **Gas Fees**: Transaction costs paid in FIL for network operations.  

When a client uploads data, they lock FIL in a wallet as payment for the provider. The provider generates a PoRep to confirm the data is stored correctly. Over time, PoSt proofs are submitted to verify ongoing storage reliability. This dual-proof system ensures providers fulfill their obligations while maintaining network security.  

### Decentralized Storage vs. Traditional Cloud Solutions
