2. **Exit Strategy**: Positions automatically close at "Till" time
3. **Risk Management**: Implement trailing stops to protect profits

### Price Variation Considerations
Price discrepancies across exchanges (typically 5 pips or more) require special attention:

- Individual execution may vary due to market conditions
- Maintain flexibility in entry/exit parameters
