## What is Pi Network?  

Launched in 2019 by Stanford University graduates, Pi Network positions itself as a decentralized cryptocurrency accessible to everyday users via a mobile app. The project claims over 60 million members globally, with a significant user base in the Netherlands.  

### Key Features of Pi Network:  
- **Mobile Mining**: Users ‚Äúmine‚Äù Pi by tapping a button once every 24 hours.  
- **Referral Incentives**: Inviting others increases mining rates, though critics argue this resembles pyramid structures.  
- **No Initial Investment**: Unlike many cryptocurrencies, Pi mining requires no hardware or upfront costs.  

**Note**: Pi Network emphasizes its goal of creating a decentralized user-owned economy, though skepticism remains about its technical viability and value proposition.

## How Much Is Pi Worth?  

While Pi is currently non-tradable, speculative valuations suggest a potential price of **‚Ç¨61 per Pi** based on IOU (I Owe You) agreements on platforms like Coinbase. However, this figure is unverified and may not reflect actual market value once trading begins.  

### Price Volatility Warning  
Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile. The price on launch day could differ significantly from pre-launch estimates due to supply-demand dynamics and investor sentiment.

## FAQ: Common Questions About Pi Trading  

### Q1: Can I sell Pi immediately after the launch?

### Q2: What if my Pi is ‚Äúlocked‚Äù?  
**A**: Some users opted to lock Pi to boost mining rates. Locked Pi becomes tradable gradually, depending on the lock-up period selected. Check your Pi Wallet for specific unlock timelines.  

### Q3: Is Pi a good investment?

## Security Best Practices  

1. **Avoid Phishing Sites**: Always verify URLs: the official OKX domain is **okx.com**.
