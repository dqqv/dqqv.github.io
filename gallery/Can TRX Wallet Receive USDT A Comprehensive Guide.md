# Can TRX Wallet Receive USDT? A Comprehensive Guide

## Understanding USDT and TRX Wallet Integration

TRX wallet (Tron Wallet) is a popular cryptocurrency wallet supporting multiple digital assets. A common question among users is: **Can TRX wallet receive USDT?** The short answer is **yes**, but let's explore the technical details and best practices.

### What Is USDT?

USDT (Tether) is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, maintaining a 1:1 value ratio. Its stability makes it ideal for traders seeking to hedge against cryptocurrency volatility. USDT operates on multiple blockchains, including Tron (TRC20) and Ethereum (ERC20).

### TRX Wallet Capabilities

TRX wallet natively supports:

- TRC20 tokens (including USDT on the Tron blockchain)
- TRX (Tron's native cryptocurrency)
- Other Tron-based assets

To receive USDT in TRX wallet, ensure you're using the **TRC20 network**. Sending USDT via ERC20 (Ethereum) to a TRX wallet may result in lost funds.
